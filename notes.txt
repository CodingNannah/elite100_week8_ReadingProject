App.js
    ANYTHING INSIDE App function div IS A CHILD
    div as Error
    HTML attributes of div:
        style
        class = className

Dictionaries:
    Cannot compare two to see if same, CAN compare id to id: x.id === y.id

Remember:
// div is entire line
// span is length of text
// react requires triple equals!

From Error.js to App.js:
{/* <small style="red"></small> */}

farthest right on props wins!
